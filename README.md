# Car-Insurance-Fraud
The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated machine learning model that can effectively identify and predict instances of fraudulent activity in car insurance claims. 
By analyzing various data attributes and patterns, the goal is to create a robust system that can assist insurance companies in detecting fraudulent claims, minimizing financial losses, and improving the overall efficiency of claim processing. 
This will contribute to a more secure and reliable car insurance ecosystem for both insurers and policyholders.
